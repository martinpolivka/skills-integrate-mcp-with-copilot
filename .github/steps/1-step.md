## Step 1: Introduction to MCP and environment setup

<img width="150" align="right" alt="copilot logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d22496d-850b-4785-aafe-11cba03cd5f2" />

In the previous Getting Started with GitHub Copilot exercise, we were introduced to the Mergington High School's extracurricular activities website, which allowed students to sign up for events.

And now we have a problem... but.. it's a good one! More teachers are asking to use it! 🎉

Our fellow teachers have lots of ideas but we can't seem to keep up with all the requests! 😮 To fix this issue, lets give GitHub Copilot an upgrade by enabling Model Context Protocol (MCP). To be more specific, we will add the GitHub MCP server, which will enable a combined workflow of issue management and website upgrades. 🧑‍🚀

Let's get started!

### 📖 Theory: What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is often referred to as "USB-C for AI" - a universal connector that allows GitHub Copilot (and other AI tools) to seamlessly interact with other services.

Essentially, it is a way to describe the capabilities and requirements of a service, so AI tools can easily determine what methods to use and to accurately provide the parameters. An MCP server is providing that interface.

### :keyboard: Activity: Get to know your environment

Before we dive into MCP, let's start up our development environment and refamiliarise ourself with the extracurricular activity application.

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account, then clone your fork to your machine.

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of this prepared workshop repository and enter its folder.
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/skills-integrate-mcp-with-copilot.git
   cd skills-integrate-mcp-with-copilot
   ```

1. Open the cloned repository in VS Code.

1. Before making changes, create your own participant branch.

   ```bash
   # Create a participant branch for your lab work.
   git switch -c participant/<your-name>
   ```

1. Validate the **Copilot Chat** and **Python** extensions are installed and enabled.

1. Verify our application runs before modification. In the left sidebar, select the **Run and Debug** tab and then press the **Start Debugging** icon.

   </details>

   <summary>🤷 Having trouble?</summary><br/>

   If the **Run and Debug** area is empty, try reloading VS Code: Open the command palette (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`) and search for `Developer: Reload Window`.

1. Use the **Ports** tab to find the webpage address, open it, and verify it is running.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the GitHub MCP server

1. Inside VS Code, open the **Copilot Chat** panel and verify **Agent** mode is selected.

   <img width="200" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/201e08ab-14a0-48bf-824e-ba4f8f43f8ab" />

   <details>
   <summary>Agent mode missing?</summary><br/>

   - Verify VS Code is at least `v1.99.0`.
   - Verify the Copilot extension is at least `v1.296.0`.
   - Check if Agent mode is enabled in your [user or workspace settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/settings#_workspace-settings).

      <img width="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/407a79dd-707e-471b-b56b-1938aece4ad8" />

   </details>

1. Inside VS Code, navigate to the `.vscode` folder, and create a new file named `mcp.json`. Paste the following contents:

   📄 **.vscode/mcp.json**

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "github": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

1. In the `.vscode/mcp.json` file, click the **Start** button and accept the prompt to authenticate with GitHub. This has just informed GitHub Copilot of the MCP server's capabilities.

   <img width="350" alt="allow authentication prompt" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5ec128d-9924-454b-8ab4-3f43ebc83cfc" /><br/>

   <img width="350" alt="mcp.json file showing running server" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c413c52d-94dc-429f-91e0-3486141908b9" />

1. In the Copilot side panel, click the **🛠️ icon** to show the additional capabilities.

   <img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1be8b80-c69c-4da5-9aea-4bbaa1c6de10" />

   <img width="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99178d1b-adbe-4cf4-ab9c-3a4d29918a13" />

1. **Commit** and **push** the `.vscode/mcp.json` file to your `participant/<your-name>` branch.

> [!NOTE]
> The next steps will involve creating GitHub issues. If you would like to avoid notification emails, you can unwatch the repository.

<details>
<summary>Having trouble?</summary><br/>

Make sure:

- Your `.vscode/mcp.json` file is similar to the example provided.
- You pushed the changes to your `participant/<your-name>` branch.
