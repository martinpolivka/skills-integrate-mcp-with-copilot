## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |

## Authentication

- Use bearer token auth for protected endpoints:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

- Demo admin account (in-memory only):

   ```
   email: admin@mergington.edu
   password: admin123
   ```

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.
